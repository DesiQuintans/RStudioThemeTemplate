# RStudioThemeTemplate

This is a SASS template for making custom RStudio themes, including editor syntax highlighting. It has the most complete support for syntax highlighting that I've yet seen.

To actually use the theme, install [SASS](sass-lang.com/) and compile the `.sass` file to a `.rstheme` file with

    sass --watch "Template_Dark.sass" "C:\Program Files\RStudio\resources\app\resources\themes\Template_Dark.rstheme"
    
And set it as your theme in RStudio. To reflect any new changes, right-click in RStudio and select Reload.


## Features

- Only has style selectors that actually do something, gleaned from long and painful element inspection in RStudio
- Properly separates syntax highlighting from Markdown highlighting/styles
- Exposes rainbow brackets and rainbow indent guides


## Limitations of RStudio/ACE editor

- You can't have text elements of different sizes; it makes the visual cursor no longer point to where the cursor actually is.
- Same for editing the padding and margins of elements too much, it makes the cursor misaligned with the real cursor position.
- Basically all items are spans and display inline. Many elements *can* be made to `display: block`, but it can have unintended effects. For example, styling the first and last line of code chunks as `display: block` means that you can have code blocks that are fully surrounded by a border or book-ended with a different colour background, but it also means that these items will fold into three separate lines instead of folding down to one line.
- The Terminal pane is a bit of a bother. The styles dedicated to its colours take up 500+ lines, so they're in a separate file that gets `@import`ed. I haven't exposed any of the terminal's colours as variables because it was way too easy to accidentally make it unusable.


## Theme preview

These colours weren't chosen to be pleasing, they were chosen to show that nearly everything can be styled in this template.

## Variable dictionary (things you can edit out-of-the-box)

If anything isn't already here, just add it yourself.
